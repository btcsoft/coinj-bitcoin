### Welcome to coinj-bitcoin

This is implementation of Coinj project inner API [coinj](https://github.com/btcsoft/coinj). 

It may be used as a standalone library to access Bitcoin network and managing your own wallet. Coinj is a fork of Bitcoinj project therefore this library offers exactly the same features.

Or it may be used in conjunction with another implementation of Coinj inner API (e.g. [coinj-litecoin](https://github.com/btcsoft/coinj-litecoin)) to implement cross-network applications.
